## Chroma (χρῶμα) means Color and Tonos (τόνος) means Sound. What if we add colors to notes? Let's see!

In the physical world visible electro-magnetic spectrum is far too different medium than sound waves in the air. We have two very different sense systems to perceive them with our eyes and ears. But then in our minds these merge into electric signals between our neurons. We are experimenting with music visualization and visual music composition as a wide field of innovative research and collective effort to introduce future generations to this elegant system.

### 12 notes in an octave starting from A match with 12 colors at 30° around the wheel of hue starting from Red

This one simple rule creates a whole new space of useful applications for learning and teaching, jamming and composing, attentive listening and intuitive performance. It all started from vector graphic designs, which then became interactive with SVG and JS. We printed the designs and opened Sticker shop, it was our version 1.0. Version 2.0 was all about experimentation on the platform of wonderful open-source tech like Vue, Vite and all other majestic NPM packages. Now we've reached version 3.0 that is signified by development of dozens of standalone web-apps that may be used offline and on almost any device.

Main hub for research is based on the [main web-site](https://chromatone.center). It includes Theory and Practice parts, that are supposed to be interconnected by a student with some guidance by a teacher or a tutor. Theory is a digital garden of music knowledge. Practice is a number of interactive web-apps that utilize this theory in actionable and really useful form.

## Chromatone web-apps

More and more apps will be coming from the laboratory of Chromatone Practice to self-contained open source HTML+JS+CSS applications. We'll be using iframes to seamlessly integrate them in the main center. Here's the list of ready to be built single-file web-apps as parts of the Chromatone ecosystem that fird their own shape as standalope PWAs.
